# Key Features:

# Natural Language Processing:
The core strength of our bot lies in its proficiency in natural language processing, courtesy of the NLTK library. By utilizing NLTK's text processing utilities, POS tagging, and named entity recognition, the bot can decipher the meaning of user queries effectively.

# User Query Analysis:
Upon receiving a user query, the bot employs NLTK to analyze and comprehend the intent behind the question. This enables the bot to identify relevant keywords and extract essential information from the text.

# Knowledge Retrieval from Wikipedia:
To enrich its responses, the bot leverages the Wikipedia Python package to fetch valuable information from the world's largest collaborative encyclopedia. This way, the bot can provide users with up-to-date and accurate insights.


# Intelligent Response Generation:
Using NLTK's powerful text generation and sentiment analysis features, the Business Advisor Bot can craft contextually appropriate responses. The bot is designed to provide valuable business advice and recommendations based on the user's query and the available data.
